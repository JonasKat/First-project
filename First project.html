					<h3>Methods of traveling</h3>
					<p>Hitchhiking (also known as thumbing or hitching, autostop)
					is a means of transportation that is gained by asking people,
					usually strangers, for a ride in their automobile or other road
					vehicle. A ride is usually, but not always free. Itinerants have
					also used hitchhiking as a primary mode of travel for the better
					part of the last century, and continue to do so today</p>

				    <p>Hitchhiking is a historically common (autonomous) practice 
					worldwide and hence there are very few places in the world where
					laws exist to restrict it. However, a minority of countries have 
					laws that restrict hitchhiking at certain locations.[3] In the United 
					States, for example, some local governments have laws outlawing hitchhiking,
					on the basis of drivers' and hitchhikers' safety. In 1946, New Jersey arrested 
					and imprisoned a hitchhiker, leading to intervention by the American Civil Liberties
					Union</p>

					<h4>Signaling method</h4>
					<p>The hitchhikers' methods of signaling to drivers differ around 
					the world. Many hitchhikers use various hand signals.If the hitchhiker 
					wishes to indicate that they need a ride, they may simply make a physical
					gesture or display a written sign. In North America, United Kingdom and most
					of Europe, the gesture involves extending the hitchhiker's arm toward the road
					and sticking the thumb of their outstretched hand upward with the hand closed.
